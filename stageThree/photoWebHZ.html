            Why are Photos dark data?
        </h1>

        <p> 
            Dark data is electronic data that is usually stored and transmitted through the cloud but now no longer serves a purpose. Photos can be considered dark data because many people take photos to capture a precious moment in their life and to post on social media. However, many photos can become quickly forgotten and will always remain on social media or on the cloud.

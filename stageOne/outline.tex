\section{Topics}
    \subsection{Text Messages} 
        \subsubsection{Members}
        \begin{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
        \subsubsection{Description}
        Text messages can be considered \textbf{dark data} because of their permanent nature they are stored in (the cloud) and 
        are normally kept well after they are sent and received. This means a lot of data has to be saved to be able to
        store the communications in large quantities of people's records. 

    \subsection{Photographs}
        \subsubsection{Members}

        \subsubsection{Description}
        Photos can be considered \textbf{dark data} as many people take lots of photos to capture a precious moment. However, these photos stack up over time and the amount of photos can range from hundreds to the millions. This means there must be lots of data storage in order to store the photos.
        I will research the consequences of the data storage of photos.

    \subsection{Video}
        \subsubsection{Members}
        \begin{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
        \subsubsection{Description}
        Case study on how much data the group generates with videos. I will carry extensive research on Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok and record how much data 
        of AI-generated content, as this type of media has a lot of AI usage.

        \subsubsection{Overview}
        There is an enormous amount of content being uploaded and accessed via the internet, mostly via large video 
        streaming companies and social media companies like Netflix, YouTube, and Twitch. I will research
        how this is stored and the consequences of having to store so much data.

        \subsubsection{Points}
        This will include how a vast amount of data is stored and where. 
        The environmental consequences of storing that data.
        The future of these companies and how they'll choose to store and deliver this data.
        How consumers use these services.

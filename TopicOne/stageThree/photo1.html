            <h3>Why is photos considered dark data</h3>
            <p>Dark data is electronic data that is usually stored and transmitted through the cloud but now no longer serves a purpose. Photos can be considered dark data because many people take photos to capture a precious moment in their life and to post on social media. However, many photos can become quickly forgotten and will always remain on social media or on the cloud.
            
            The mean value of a photo’s file size is approximately 2.64 megabytes (This is calculated by finding the average from 5 photos).  The photos were picked randomly and had varying levels of quality. As a group with 6 members, we calculated that we capture 2.8 photos per member on average, therefore 14 photos are taken which has a total of 37 megabytes (MB) per week. That is 1924 MB per year from 6 people, which means that for the annual storage requirements for 1 person will be approximately 321 MB.  The population of Glasgow in 2021 was 635,130 people (Population and Projections - Glasgow City Council, no date), so by using the data for the population in Glasgow and the annual storage requirements, an estimate of 203 million MB of dark data worth of photos is produced in Glasgow per year. The assumptions that were made is that all of the people in Glasgow take photos but in reality, there are young babies who don’t use phones or elderly people who can’t navigate their way around technology. Another assumption is that no photos were deleted and also that all photos that were captured are all dark data, meaning all photos were not used again.  An additional assumption is that people in Glasgow consistently produced 2.8 photos per week, whereas in reality, this number can fluctuate as there could be an abundance of photographers in Glasgow, which will take significantly more photos than the average person, therefore boosting the amount of dark data produced. Another assumption is that the photo size remained the same, some photos taken can vary in size which can change the file size therefore changing the value of carbon emissions produced for the better or worse. 
            
            To store this large amount of dark data, it must be stored in a data warehouse, specifically a storage facility that is capable of storing large amounts of data such as a HPC facility that can hold several petabytes (Schembera and Durán, 2020). The power consumption in order to store 1 giga byte (GB) is 5 kilo Watts per hour (Costenaro and Duer, no date), so in order to store 203,877 GB worth of data, it requires just above 1 million kilo watts per hour (kWh) in order to store in a data warehouse for 1 year that was generated in one city, which just includes only photos. To cover the expenses of storing that data, £0.42 is spent for GB of data stored, (Costenaro and Duer, no date) so in order to cover for Glasgow’s dark data storage, it is approximately £85,628 per year. Due to the fact that it requires a large amount of power in order to store this data, it will inevitably produce a great level of carbon emissions that will harm the environment. For every kWh, this will produce 162 g of carbon dioxide (Analysis: UK electricity from fossil fuels drops to lowest level since 1957 - Carbon Brief, no date) therefore, the carbon emissions produced by Glasgow’s dark data worth of photos is roughly 1620 kg per year.
